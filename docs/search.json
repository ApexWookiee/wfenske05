However, this is not the case. Instead, this map tells us that Republicans won 5 of 8 available districts with democrats claiming the remaining 3. Gerrymandering is hard to explicitly prove, but intuition tells us that something is off. It is for this reason that we might create these kinds of maps before moving to rigorous statistical methods to tell us if something is unexpected."

However, even states like Florida and Texas do not have as many as CA and NY. This is interesting, suggesting that terrorism may not be a symptom of a larger population but rather something else. Maybe it is economic power or perhaps connection to countries overseas, both of which are strong in NY and CA. Perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that NY and CA are very much symbols of what America stands for.\nAdditionally, there is a large absence of terrorist attacks in the the non coastal states with the exception of Illinois. It is possible that total population does not matter as much, rather the concentration of the population is what matters. Big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, NYC, etc., are definitely attractive targets for potential attackers."
